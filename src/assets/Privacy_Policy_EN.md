# ReadLuck App Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 27, 2025 (v1.0)

This Privacy Policy describes how the desktop application ReadLuck (“Application”) handles information. Our commitment is to the user's complete privacy, which is why the application was designed to function entirely offline, without collecting or transmitting personal data.

## Clause 1: Data Collection and Use

ReadLuck **does not collect, store, transmit, or process** any personally identifiable or sensitive user information.

* **Local Data:** All data you enter into the application — such as book titles, author names, page numbers, reading status ("Not Read", "Reading", "Completed"), favorites, and draw history — are saved **exclusively on your own device** (computer).
* **Access:** This data is not accessible by the developer or any third parties through the application. Operation is entirely local.

## Clause 2: Information Sharing

Since no personal data is collected, there is no information to be shared with third parties. Occasionally, the application may display a link to an official website for information about new versions, documentation, or donations. When clicking such links, you will be directed to an external environment, subject to its own and independent privacy policies.

## Clause 3: Tracking Technologies

This application does not use cookies, pixels, or any other user activity tracking technologies.

## Clause 4: Security

The application is developed with good security practices to protect its integrity and avoid vulnerabilities. The security of the data entered in the application is the user’s responsibility, as the files are stored locally on their own computer.

## Clause 5: Changes to this Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future to reflect improvements or to comply with new legal requirements. The "Last updated" date at the top of the document will indicate when revisions were made.

## Clause 6: Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the official website or email address to be provided in future versions of the application.
